## Frontend

The frontend is built using a modern stack to deliver a fast and responsive user experience:

- **Tech Stack**: ReactJS + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Why this stack?**: Vite ensures lightning-fast development and builds, while Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach for rapid and consistent styling.
### Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
2. **Run Project**:
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

## Backend

The backend provides a powerful API built with TypeScript and documented with Swagger for easy testing and integration:

- **Tech Stack**: Node.js + TypeScript + Swagger
- **Why this stack?**: TypeScript ensures type safety and better maintainability, while Swagger delivers interactive API documentation out of the box.
### Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
